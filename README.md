#LI1-Project

This was my first assignment in college.

The project consisted in using our knowlege of functional programming to implement the game [Bomberman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomberman) using Haskell.

The project was divided in tasks, and each one served the single purpose of controlling a part of the game (for example, generating the map, or the passing of time). The final tasks were to implement a graphical interface for the game using [Gloss](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/gloss) and to implement a bot that simulated human gameplay.

Our professors actually set up a hall of fame for the best assignments, in which they can be played.
